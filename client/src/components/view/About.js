          Coruscant (pronounced /'kɔɹəsɑnt/), also known as Imperial Center during the rule of the Galactic Empire, 
          was an ecumenopolis—a city-covered planet, collectively known as Galactic City—in the Coruscant system of the Core Worlds. 
          Noted for its cosmopolitan culture and towering skyscrapers, Coruscant's population consisted of approximately one 
          trillion citizens hailing from a vast array of both humanoid and alien species. Though debated by historians, it was 
          generally believed that Coruscant was the original homeworld of humanity. In addition, Coruscant's strategic location 
          at the end of several major trade routes enabled it to grow in power and influence, causing the city-planet to surpass 
          its early rivals and become the hub of galactic culture, education, finance, fine arts, politics and technology. It was the 
          location of several major landmarks, including the Jedi Temple, Monument Plaza and the Senate Building.
