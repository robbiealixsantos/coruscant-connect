          <p>Coruscant (pronounced /'kɔɹəsɑnt/), also known as Imperial Center during the rule of the Galactic Empire, 
          was an ecumenopolis—a city-covered planet, collectively known as Galactic City—in the Coruscant system of the Core Worlds. 
          Noted for its cosmopolitan culture and towering skyscrapers, Coruscant's population consisted of approximately one 
          trillion citizens hailing from a vast array of both humanoid and alien species. Though debated by historians, it was 
          generally believed that Coruscant was the original homeworld of humanity. In addition, Coruscant's strategic location 
          at the end of several major trade routes enabled it to grow in power and influence, causing the city-planet to surpass 
          its early rivals and become the hub of galactic culture, education, finance, fine arts, politics and technology. It was the 
          location of several major landmarks, including the Jedi Temple, Monument Plaza and the Senate Building.</p>

          <p>The planet is considered a Milliarium Aureum; the chronological and navigational center of the galaxy. 
          The XYZ coordinates were 0,0,0 and the grid coordinates were L-9. The Galactic Standard Calendar was the standard chronometric 
          in the Star Wars galaxy. It centered on the Coruscant tropical year. The Coruscant solar cycle was 368 days long; with a day 
          consisting of 360 NET degrees (or 24 standard hours), the same as Earth.[13] Numerous epochs were used to determine calendar eras. 
          The most recent of these calendar eras used the Battle of Yavin (i.e. the destruction of the first Death Star) as its epoch, 
          or "year zero": BBY (Before the Battle of Yavin), and ABY (After the Battle of Yavin).[14] The earliest date in the Star Wars 
          expanded universe as a whole is 13,000,000,000 BBY, which serves as the year the universe was created 
          (though Coruscant's formation is not dated).</p>
